/**
 * minecraftTheme.js — Image-based Minecraft theme for AngleMaze.
 *
 * WHAT: Loads external PNG assets and provides themed rendering functions.
 *   All images are loaded from public/assets/ during preload().
 *   If any image fails to load, the game falls back to flat-color rendering.
 *
 * WHY external images instead of procedural textures?
 *   Phaser's textures.generate() only supports 16 fixed colors — the output
 *   looks crude and nothing like real Minecraft graphics. Real PNG assets with
 *   proper shading, noise, and color variation are required for the look.
 *
 * HOW it works:
 *   1. preloadThemeAssets(scene) — call from MazeScene.preload().
 *      Queues all PNGs for loading. Phaser downloads them in parallel.
 *   2. isThemeLoaded(scene) — check in create() whether all assets loaded.
 *      Returns true only if every texture exists in the Texture Manager.
 *   3. Helper functions — drawThemedBackground(), drawThemedWalls(), etc.
 *      Each checks isThemeLoaded() and falls back to flat colors if false.
 *
 * PERFORMANCE NOTES:
 *   - TileSprite uses GL_REPEAT internally — the GPU tiles the texture.
 *     Zero CPU cost per frame for the grass background.
 *   - Wall textures are drawn ONCE to a RenderTexture (offscreen canvas),
 *     then displayed as a single image. No per-frame re-drawing.
 *   - Sprites (player, enemies, exit) are standard Phaser sprites —
 *     one draw call each per frame. Total: ~8 draw calls for sprites.
 *   - All textures are 32×32 or 48×48 — tiny GPU memory footprint.

// ── Asset keys and paths ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// WHAT: Mapping of texture keys (used in Phaser code) to file paths.
// WHY: Centralizes all asset references. To swap an image, change the path
//   here — no hunting through MazeScene.js for hardcoded strings.
// HOW: Paths are relative to the Vite `public/` folder.
//   `public/assets/grass.png` → served at `/assets/grass.png`.

/**
 * preloadThemeAssets(scene)
 *
 * WHAT: Queues all Minecraft theme images for loading.
 *   Must be called from MazeScene.preload() — Phaser's loader only
 *   auto-starts during the preload lifecycle phase.
 *
 * WHY in preload() and not create()?
 *   Phaser guarantees that all assets queued in preload() are fully
 *   downloaded before create() runs. If you queue images in create(),
 *   they won't be available immediately — you'd need to manually start
 *   the loader and wait for completion events. preload() handles this
 *   automatically.
 *
 * HOW: this.load.image(key, path) adds the image to the download queue.
 *   Phaser downloads all queued files in parallel, shows a loading state
 *   if configured, and only calls create() when everything is ready.
 *

 * WHY setOrigin(0)?
 *   By default, Phaser positions sprites by their CENTER. setOrigin(0)
 *   changes the anchor to the TOP-LEFT corner, so (0, 0) means the
 *   sprite's top-left corner is at the canvas's top-left corner.

/**
 * drawThemedWalls(scene, walls)
 *
 * WHAT: Draws all wall segments using the dirt texture image.
 *   Each wall is rendered as a series of dirt.png sprites stamped along
 *   the wall's path, like laying bricks in a line.
 *   Falls back to colored lines if the dirt texture didn't load.
 *
 * WHY stamp sprites instead of drawing textured lines?
 *   Phaser's Graphics API (lineStyle + strokePath) only draws SOLID COLORS.
 *   It cannot fill a line with an image pattern. To show the actual dirt.png
 *   texture on walls, we must place image-based game objects along the path.
 *
 * HOW it works:
 *   For each wall segment (x1,y1) → (x2,y2):
 *     1. Calculate the angle: atan2(dy, dx)
 *     2. Calculate the length: sqrt(dx² + dy²)
 *     3. Place sprites every STAMP_SPACING pixels along the line.
 *     4. Each sprite is rotated to match the wall's angle.
 *     5. Each sprite is scaled to WALL_DRAW_THICKNESS height
 *        and STAMP_SPACING width, so they butt up against each other
 *        with no gaps.
 *
 * PERFORMANCE:
 *   A typical maze has ~40 wall segments averaging ~150px each.
 *   At STAMP_SPACING=20, that's ~300 sprites total. Phaser handles
 *   this easily — all share the same texture so WebGL batches them
 *   into very few draw calls.
 *
 * COLLISION NOTE:
 *   This function only changes VISUALS. The invisible physics bodies
 *   (created separately by createWallBodies) are unchanged.
 *   The visual wall thickness (WALL_DRAW_THICKNESS) can differ from
 *   the physics thickness (WALL_THICKNESS) — the visual is just decoration.

/**
 * updatePlayerRotation(player, facingAngle, themed, scene)
 *
 * WHAT: Smoothly rotates the player sprite to match the new facing direction

 *
 * WHY animate instead of instant?
 *   Instant rotation (setAngle) jumps from 0° to 90° in one frame — it looks
 *   robotic and disorienting, especially with a character sprite. A short
 *   tween (200ms) shows the character physically turning, which:
 *     - Feels natural and alive
 *     - Gives the kid visual confirmation that the turn happened
 *     - Makes large turns (180°) feel appropriately dramatic
 *
 * HOW the tween works:
 *   Phaser's tween system interpolates a property from its current value
 *   to a target value over a duration. We tween `player.angle` (Phaser's
 *   internal rotation in degrees).
 *
 *   The tricky part is DIRECTION. We want the sprite to take the SHORTEST
 *   path around the circle. Without correction:
 *     0° → 350° would rotate 350° clockwise instead of 10° counterclockwise.
 *
 *   We fix this by computing the shortest angular difference (always between
 *   -180° and +180°) and tweening by that delta from the current angle.
 *
 * WHY `scene` parameter?
 *   Phaser tweens are created via `scene.tweens.add()`. The previous version
 *   didn't need the scene because setAngle() is a direct property setter.
 *   Tweens require the scene's tween manager.

 *
 * WHAT: Starts a subtle walking oscillation on the player sprite —
 *   a repeating side-to-side rock (±4°) combined with a small
 *   vertical bob (±1.5px) — that plays continuously while the
 *   player is moving forward.
 *
 * WHY two oscillations combined?
 *   Rotation alone looks like the character is drunk, not walking.
 *   Vertical bob alone looks like bouncing, not walking.
 *   Together they create a "waddle" — the natural motion of a
 *   Minecraft-style blocky character walking, viewed from above.
 *
 * HOW it handles facing angle:
 *   The rock oscillates RELATIVE to the current facing direction.
 *   If the player faces 90° (up), the Phaser angle is 0° (90 - 90).
 *   The tween rocks between -4° and +4° around that base angle.
 *   This works at any facing direction automatically because the
 *   tween target is baseAngle ± offset, not an absolute value.
 *
 * HOW it loops:
 *   yoyo: true makes the tween reverse after reaching the target.
 *   repeat: -1 makes it loop forever (until manually stopped).
 *   Together: the sprite rocks left → right → left → right... endlessly.
 *
 * PERFORMANCE:

  //   ±2° is too subtle (invisible at this scale).
  //   ±8° is too much (looks like the character is falling over).
  //
  // TIMING: 150ms per half-cycle = 300ms full rock (left → right → left).
  //   At MOVE_SPEED=300 px/s and a typical move of 50px (167ms duration),
  //   the player sees about half a rock cycle per short move, or 2-3 full
  //   cycles for a 200px move. This feels natural — not frantic, not slow.
  //
  // WHY start at baseAngle - 4 (not baseAngle)?

  //   ±4° was invisible (rounded away by pixel-art filtering).
  //   ±10° was too dramatic (looked like falling, not walking).

  // ── Vertical bob (±1.5px oscillation) ─────────────────────────────────
  //
  // WHAT: Oscillates scaleX and scaleY slightly to create a "breathing"
  //   or "bouncing" effect that simulates the weight shift of walking.
  //
  // WHY scale instead of y position?
  //   The previous version tweened player.y directly. But Phaser's physics
  //   engine ALSO sets player.y every frame based on velocity. The two
  //   systems fought over the same property — the tween won, pinning the
  //   player in place and preventing all forward movement.
  //   Scale (scaleX, scaleY) is purely visual — physics never touches it.
  //   So there's no conflict.
  //
  // HOW it looks:
  //   The sprite slightly squishes horizontally and stretches vertically,
  //   then reverses. Combined with the rotation rock, it creates a
  //   convincing "waddle" at the Minecraft pixel-art scale.
  //
  // WHY store original scales?
  //   setDisplaySize changes scaleX/scaleY internally. We need to restore
  //   the exact values when the animation stops, not assume they're 1.0.
  
  // NOTE: No squash-stretch (scaleX/scaleY) tween.
  //
  // WHY it was removed:
  //   Oscillating scaleY interferes with Arcade Physics body bounds
  //   during downward movement. The body size fluctuates every frame,
  //   causing jittery collision resolution that makes the sprite bounce
  //   chaotically when moving in the +Y direction.
  //
  //   Left/right/up movement looked fine because the scale oscillation
  //   was perpendicular to travel (left/right) or dampened symmetrically (up).
  //   But downward movement amplified the jitter.
  //
  // The ±6° rotation rock alone is sufficient for a convincing walk
  // animation at this sprite scale. No scale changes needed.

 *   Also, the tween might be stopped mid-cycle (e.g., player hits a wall
 *   at the peak of a rock). Without resetting, the sprite would freeze

 * HOW it cleans up:
 *   1. Stop both tweens (rotation and bob).
 *   2. Restore Y to the stored original value.
 *   3. Do NOT reset angle here — the caller (goForward callback or
 *      _onWallHit) will call setPreviewAngle() which resets the angle
 *      via updatePlayerRotation(). Setting it here too would cause a
 *      visible double-snap.
 *
