/**
 * WALL_THICKNESS controls how wide (or tall) the invisible physics rectangle
 * is for each wall segment, measured perpendicular to the wall's direction.
 *
 * WHY we need thickness at all: Arcade Physics uses Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes
 * (AABBs) — rectangles, not lines. A true zero-width line has no area, so the
 * engine would never detect a collision against it. We give each wall a small
 * but non-zero thickness so the physics engine has something to collide with.
 *
 * HOW to choose the value: it should be ≥ 1 px, but large enough that a fast-
 * moving player cannot "tunnel" through the wall in a single frame. 8 px is a
 * safe choice when the player is ~20 px wide.
 *
 * Tip: to see where all the physics rectangles are, temporarily set
 * `debug: true` in config.js — Phaser will draw green outlines around them.

 * MOVE_SPEED — how fast the player travels during a move, in pixels per second.

 * At 300 px/s a 100-pixel move takes 333 ms — fast enough to feel responsive,
 * slow enough to watch the player navigate corridors.
 *
 * Changing this value speeds up or slows down ALL moves proportionally because
 * the timer duration is calculated as (distance / MOVE_SPEED) — so the player
 * always travels the requested distance regardless of what this is set to.
 */

/**
 * TILE_SIZE — side length (in pixels) of each small square placed along a
 * diagonal wall to approximate its collision shape.
 *
 * WHAT: When we create physics bodies for a diagonal wall, we can't use one
 *   big rectangle (Arcade Physics only supports axis-aligned boxes — see the
 *   explanation in the guide). Instead, we place many tiny squares along the
 *   line. TILE_SIZE controls how big each square is.
 *
 * WHY 8 pixels?
 *   - Smaller tiles (4 px) = smoother collision, but MORE physics bodies = slower.
 *   - Bigger tiles (16 px) = fewer bodies = faster, but GAPS between tiles
 *     could let the player squeeze through.
 *   - 8 px is a good balance: tiles overlap slightly (because the player is
 *     20 px wide), so there are no gaps, and the performance cost is low.
 *
 * HOW to visualize it: imagine placing 8×8 pixel sticky notes along a
 *   diagonal pencil line on graph paper. Each note is its own collision box.

/**
 * LEVEL_CONFIG — per-level settings for start position, exit position,

 *
 * WHAT: A lookup table mapping level number → positions and angle.

 *
 * WHY centralize this?
 *   Before this change, the start (60,60), exit (740,540), and facing angle (0°)
 *   were hardcoded as bare numbers scattered across create(). If you wanted
 *   Level 2 to start in a different corner, you'd need to find and modify
 *   5+ places. With LEVEL_CONFIG, you change ONE object and everything updates.
 *
 * HOW it's used:
 *   In create(), we read:
 *     const cfg = LEVEL_CONFIG[this.game._currentLevel];
 *   Then use cfg.startX, cfg.startY, etc. wherever we previously had
 *   hardcoded numbers.
 *
 * HOW to add a new level:
 *   Just add a new entry: 3: { startX: ..., startY: ..., ... }
 *
 * COORDINATE REMINDER:
 *   (0,0) = top-left. X increases → right. Y increases ↓ down.
 *   facingAngle: 0° = right, 90° = up, 180° = left, 270° = down.

/**
 * createDiagonalWallBodies(scene, x1, y1, x2, y2, wallGroup)
 *
 * WHAT: Creates a chain of small square static physics bodies along a
 *   diagonal line from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2). Each square is TILE_SIZE × TILE_SIZE
 *   pixels and is added to the wallGroup for collision detection.
 *
 * WHY we need this (the AABB problem):
 *   Phaser Arcade Physics uses Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) — every
 *   collision shape is a rectangle whose sides are PARALLEL to the screen edges.
 *   This works perfectly for horizontal/vertical walls. But for a diagonal wall,
 *   a single AABB would be a fat rectangle covering much more area than the
 *   actual wall line:
 *
 *     Diagonal wall:        Single AABB (wrong!):
 *           ██              ┌────────────┐
 *         ██                │xxxx        │  ← blocks open space
 *       ██                  │  xxxx      │
 *     ██                    │    xxxx    │
 *   ██                      └────────────┘
 *
 *   By using many small squares along the line, we get an accurate
 *   collision shape that follows the diagonal closely.
 *
 * HOW the math works (parametric line equation):
 *   1. Find the angle of the wall:
 *        angle = atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)
 *      This gives us the direction from the start to the end point.
 *
 *   2. Find the total length of the wall:
 *        length = sqrt((x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²)
 *
 *   3. Calculate how many tiles we need:
 *        numTiles = ceil(length / TILE_SIZE)
 *
 *   4. For each tile i (from 0 to numTiles), compute its position:
 *        tileX = x1 + i × TILE_SIZE × cos(angle)
 *        tileY = y1 + i × TILE_SIZE × sin(angle)
 *
 *      This is the PARAMETRIC LINE EQUATION — it says:
 *      "Start at (x1, y1), then step forward i×TILE_SIZE pixels
 *       in the direction of the wall."
 *
 *   Visual example — a 45° wall from (100, 300) to (200, 200):
 *     angle = atan2(200-300, 200-100) = atan2(-100, 100) ≈ -0.785 rad (-45°)
 *     length = sqrt(100² + 100²) ≈ 141 px
 *     numTiles = ceil(141 / 8) = 18 tiles
 *
 *     Tile 0:  (100, 300)         — start
 *     Tile 1:  (105.7, 294.3)     — one step along the diagonal
 *     Tile 2:  (111.3, 288.6)     — another step
 *     ...
 *     Tile 17: (195.6, 205.6)     — near the end

    //       themselves — perfect for maze walls.
    //
    // WHY static instead of dynamic?
    //   Dynamic bodies recalculate velocity, gravity, and position every single

    //     this.physics.add.collider(player, this.wallGroup)

    //
    // HOW Arcade Physics handles collision:
    //   Every frame Phaser checks every dynamic body against every static body
    //   it shares a collider with. If their AABBs overlap, Phaser pushes the
    //   dynamic body out of the static body along the axis of least overlap.

    // HOW: The createWallBodies() function (defined outside this class)

    //   - Straight walls → one efficient rectangle body
    //   - Diagonal walls → a chain of small squares along the line

    //   The start zone is purely decorative — we don't want the player to
    //   bounce off it or be blocked by it. A game object only participates in
    //   the physics simulation if you explicitly call `physics.add.existing()`
    //   (or create it via a physics factory method). Without that call, Phaser
    //   treats it as a plain display object.
    // HOW: `this.add.rectangle(x, y, w, h, fillColor, fillAlpha)` creates a
    //   filled rectangle centred at (x, y). The 6th argument (0–1) controls
    //   how transparent the fill is — 0.5 lets the background show through.
    //
    // Cell [0,0] spans x=0–200, y=0–200.
    // (60, 60) is well clear of the boundary walls and the x=300 stub.
    
    // WHAT: Draw the start zone at the position from LEVEL_CONFIG.

    // WHAT: A gold rectangle that marks the goal the player must reach.
    //
    // WHY does the exit zone need a physics body when the start zone doesn't?
    //   Phaser's overlap system only works when BOTH objects have physics bodies.
    //   If exitZone had no body, `physics.add.overlap()` would silently never
    //   fire. We make it STATIC so it has zero per-frame cost (same reasoning
    //   as the walls), while still being detectable by the overlap system.
    //
    // WHY overlap instead of collider for the exit zone?
    //   `physics.add.collider` resolves the overlap physically — the dynamic
    //   body is pushed OUT of the static body each frame (like hitting a wall).
    //   `physics.add.overlap` fires a callback when the AABBs intersect but
    //   does NOT alter the physics — the player glides through the zone
    //   naturally. For a goal zone you want detection without a bounce.
    //
    // Cell [3,2] spans x=600–800, y=400–600.
    // (740, 540) sits comfortably inside, clear of the x=600 and x=800 walls.
    // WHAT: Draw the exit zone at the position from LEVEL_CONFIG.
    // WHY: Level 1 exits bottom-right (740,540). Level 2 exits near top-left (150,50).

    // WHY draw the static ring before the trail and player?
    //   Phaser renders objects in the order they are added to the scene.
    //   The first object added is drawn at the bottom (behind everything else).
    //   By drawing the compass ring now, it sits below trail lines and the
    //   player — the ring is background reference art, not interactive.

    //   full path history through the maze.
    //
    // WHY NOT clear it each frame?
    //   Unlike the direction arrow (which needs to move with the player and is
    //   cleared and redrawn on every angle change), the trail is permanent: we
    //   WANT the old path segments to stay visible. So we only ADD to this
    //   Graphics object (inside movePlayer's callback), never clear it.
    //
    // WHY created BEFORE the player?
    //   Phaser's z-order is determined by creation order. Creating trailGfx
    //   before the player means trail lines will appear underneath the player

    // HOW collideWorldBounds works:
    //   Without this, a dynamic body can fly past the canvas edge if given
    //   enough velocity. `setCollideWorldBounds(true)` registers the canvas
    //   boundaries as invisible hard walls so the player always stays inside.
    //   This complements the outer boundary wall segments: the physics wall
    //   bodies stop the player from *touching* the edge lines, and
    //   collideWorldBounds acts as a final safety net.
    this.player.body.setCollideWorldBounds(true);

    // WHAT: `physics.add.collider(A, B, callback, processCallback, context)`
    //   tests A against every member of B each frame. If their AABBs overlap,
    //   Phaser first calls `processCallback` (null = always process), then
    //   resolves the collision (pushes A out of B), then calls `callback`.
    //
    // WHY add a callback here?
    //   In the old version (no callback), wall contact just stopped the player.
    //   Now we want wall contact to RESTART the game — that logic lives in
    //   `_onWallHit`. The callback is the hook Phaser gives us to run custom
    //   code on every collision.
    //
    // WHY pass `this` as the context (5th argument)?
    //   The callback `this._onWallHit` is an object method. Phaser calls it as
    //   a plain function, which would make `this` undefined inside it. Passing
    //   the scene as the context binds `this` correctly — just like
    //   `.bind(this)` but without creating a new function each call.

    // ── 8b. Player direction indicator (renders above the player square) ──────
    //
    // WHAT: A small filled white triangle drawn on top of the player, pointing
    //   in the player's current facing direction. It acts as an on-body compass
    //   needle — the player square always shows which way the player is facing.
    //
    // WHY a separate Graphics object from arrowGfx?
    //   Two reasons:
    //   • Z-order: the indicator must sit above the player square but can share
    //     the same layer as the external arrow.
    //   • Behaviour during moves: both are hidden mid-move (arrow at stale
    //     position, indicator at stale position), and both are restored
    //     together via setPreviewAngle() when the move ends.
    //
    // HOW the triangle geometry works:
    //   • TIP: 8 px from player centre in the facing direction.
    //   • BASE CORNERS: 5 px from player centre, ±120° off the facing direction.
    //   This produces a compact equilateral-ish triangle that fits comfortably
    //   inside the player's 10 px half-width (20 px total side length).
    this.playerIndicatorGfx = this.add.graphics();

    // ── 9. Direction preview arrow (renders above indicator) ──────────────────
    //
    // WHAT: A Graphics object that draws a yellow arrow from the player's
    //   position in the currently facing direction. It is CLEARED and REDRAWN
    //   whenever the facing direction changes (via setPreviewAngle), and HIDDEN
    //   during a move (to avoid misleading positions while the player travels).
    //
    // WHY created AFTER the player and indicator?
    //   z-order: the arrow shaft starts at the player centre and extends outward
    //   past the player edge. It needs to render on top of everything else in
    //   the player's immediate area so the arrowhead is always fully visible.
    //
    // HOW the clear-and-redraw pattern works:
    //   `arrowGfx.clear()` erases all previous draw calls on this object.
    //   Then we call the draw commands again with the new position/angle.
    //   This is the standard Phaser idiom for dynamic vector graphics that
    //   change shape or position on every update.

    //   the player's current (or preview) facing direction. Updates live as the
    //   player changes the direction controls.
    //
    // WHY created after arrowGfx (topmost layer)?
    //   The needle must always be visible, even if trail lines reach the
    //   bottom-left corner where the compass lives. Being on top guarantees it
    //   is never obscured.
    //
    // WHY separate from the static ring drawn in _drawCompass()?
    //   The ring, tick marks, and labels are drawn once and never change.
    //   The needle changes every time the facing angle changes. Keeping them
    //   on separate Graphics objects lets us `clear()` and redraw just the
    //   needle, leaving the static ring untouched — efficient and correct.

    // ── 10. Game state ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    /**
     * WHAT: The player's current facing direction, in degrees.
     *   0° = facing right, 90° = facing up, 180° = left, 270° = down.
     *   Counterclockwise positive (standard math convention — like a protractor).
     *
     * TURTLE GRAPHICS MODEL — "turn in place, then walk forward":
     *   This game uses the same movement model as Python's turtle library.
     *   There are three separate commands — each does exactly ONE thing:
     *
     *     ▶ turnLeft(degrees)   — rotate CCW (left), don't move.
     *     ▶ turnRight(degrees)  — rotate CW  (right), don't move.
     *     ▶ goForward(distance) — walk forward in the current facing direction.
     *
     *   Like giving directions to a robot:
     *     "Turn left 90°."   ← robot spins, doesn't move
     *     "Walk 100 steps."  ← robot walks in whichever direction it faces
     *
     * WHY separate turning from moving?
     *   Combining them ("turn AND move") hides two distinct decisions:
     *     1. Which direction should I face?  → turnLeft / turnRight
     *     2. How far should I go?            → goForward
     *   Separating them lets students focus on one question at a time — which
     *   is exactly how a protractor exercise works in class.
     *
     * HOW facingAngle accumulates:
     *   turnLeft  ADDS degrees   (+CCW): facing 0° + left  45° → 45°  (upper-right)
     *   turnRight SUBTRACTS      (−CW):  facing 90° + right 45° → 45° (upper-right)
     *
     *   Example — "turn left 45°, turn left 45°":
     *     Start:      facingAngle = 0°   (facing right)
     *     Left 45°:   facingAngle = 45°  (facing upper-right)
     *     Left 45°:   facingAngle = 90°  (facing straight UP) ✓
     *
     * HOW double-modulo normalization keeps angles in [0, 360):
     *   JavaScript's `%` returns negative values for negative inputs:
     *     (-30) % 360  →  -30  in JS   ✗  (we want 330)
     *   Pattern: ((angle % 360) + 360) % 360  →  always [0, 360)  ✓
     *
     *   Example — facing 10°, turnRight(45°):
     *     10 + (−45) = −35
     *     (−35 % 360)  →  −35
     *     −35 + 360    →  325
     *     325 % 360    →  325  ✓  (facing lower-right, ~5 o'clock)

    //
    // JavaScript's Math.cos / Math.sin take radians, not degrees.
    // Conversion: radians = degrees × (π / 180).
    // We keep the UI in degrees because "turn 90°" is immediately understood;
    // "turn 1.5708 radians" is not.
    const angleRad = (this.facingAngle * Math.PI) / 180;

    // ── Polar → Cartesian unit vector ─────────────────────────────────────────
    //
    // Convert facing direction to (dx, dy) — how far to move per pixel:
    //   dx =  cos(θ)   ← rightward component  (positive X = right)
    //   dy = −sin(θ)   ← downward component   (NEGATED because Phaser Y-down)
    //
    // WHY negate dy?
    //   In standard math, 90° → sin(90°) = +1 → moves UP.
    //   In Phaser, Y increases DOWNWARD, so +1 in vy moves DOWN — opposite!
    //   Negating makes 90° move toward smaller Y values (= up the screen). ✓
    //
    // Example — facingAngle = 45°, distance = 100 px:
    //   dx =  cos(45°) ≈ +0.707  →  vx ≈ +212 px/s  (right)
    //   dy = −sin(45°) ≈ −0.707  →  vy ≈ −212 px/s  (up)
    //   Combined speed = √(212² + 212²) ≈ 300 px/s = MOVE_SPEED  ✓
    let dx =  Math.cos(angleRad);
    let dy = -Math.sin(angleRad); // negated for Phaser Y-down

    // WHAT: Clamp near-zero values to exactly zero.
    //
    // WHY: JavaScript's floating-point math produces tiny errors:
    //   cos(270°) = 6.12e-17 instead of 0
    //   sin(180°) = 1.22e-16 instead of 0
    //
    //   These near-zero values create a minuscule velocity on the
    //   "wrong" axis. For example, facing straight down (270°):
    //     Intended: vx=0, vy=300
    //     Actual:   vx=0.00000002, vy=300
    //
    //   That tiny vx pushes the player into vertical wall edges.
    //   Physics corrects the overlap by pushing back. Next frame
    //   it drifts again. Push back again. → visible jitter.
    //
    // HOW: If |dx| or |dy| is smaller than EPSILON (1e-10), snap to 0.
    //   This threshold is small enough to never affect real diagonal
    //   movement (cos(45°) = 0.707 — far above 1e-10) but catches
    //   all floating-point ghosts near cardinal directions.
    //
    // WHICH ANGLES ARE AFFECTED:
    //   0°   (right): cos=1 ✓, sin=0 (has error) → dy clamped
    //   90°  (up):    cos=0 (has error), sin=1 ✓ → dx clamped
    //   180° (left):  cos=-1 ✓, sin=0 (has error) → dy clamped
    //   270° (down):  cos=0 (has error), sin=-1 ✓ → dx clamped
    //   45°, 60° etc: both components are large → no clamping → correct

   *     Left 45°:   45 + 45 = 90°  (straight up) ✓

  /**
   * setPreviewAngle(angleDeg)
   *
   * WHAT: Draws (or redraws) three direction indicators simultaneously:
   *   1. The external ARROW  — a yellow arrow from the player's position.
   *   2. The on-body TRIANGLE — a small filled triangle inside the player square.
   *   3. The COMPASS NEEDLE  — a line from the compass ring's centre to its rim.
   *
   *   All three always point in the same direction (angleDeg), providing
   *   redundant, at-a-glance confirmation of the current facing/preview angle.
   *
   * CALLED FROM:
   *   • turnLeft() / turnRight() — immediately after updating facingAngle,
   *     to rotate all three direction indicators at once. Instant, no timer.
   *   • goForward's delayedCall callback — after a move ends, to restore the
   *     arrow and triangle at the new (post-move) player position.
   *   • create() — once at startup with facingAngle = 0 (facing right).
   *
   * WHY clear-and-redraw for the arrow and triangle (but not the trail)?
   *   The arrow and triangle always show the CURRENT state — only one should
   *   ever be visible at a time. Without `clear()`, every call would add a
   *   new arrow/triangle on top of the old ones, creating visual clutter.
   *   The trail intentionally accumulates (see movePlayer comments).
   *
   * @param {number} angleDeg  Angle in degrees (0° right, 90° up, CCW positive).
   *                           During live preview this is the computed post-turn
   *                           angle; after a move this equals this.facingAngle.

   *   created in create()) and drawn/updated via setPreviewAngle().
   *
   * WHY?
   *   The angle convention (0° = right, 90° = UP, CCW = positive) is the
   *   opposite of the screen's Y-axis and non-obvious to newcomers. A
   *   permanent reference removes the need to memorise the convention.
   *
   * WHY a private helper (underscore prefix)?
   *   JavaScript doesn't have true private methods, but the `_` prefix is a
   *   community convention meaning "internal — don't call this from outside
   *   the class". It signals that this is an implementation detail.
   *
   * HOW: Called once from create() before trailGfx and the player, so the
   *   static ring sits at the bottom of the z-stack. The needle is created
   *   last in create() so it renders above everything else.
